# ChatVote E2E Test Plan

## Application Overview

ChatVote is an AI-powered political information chatbot for French elections. Users can ask questions to multiple political parties simultaneously and receive source-backed, streamed answers via Socket.IO. The application is a Next.js 16 app using Firebase Auth (anonymous, Google, email, Microsoft), Firestore for session persistence, Zustand for state management, and Socket.IO for real-time streaming. The test environment uses a mock Socket.IO server on port 8080 that returns deterministic responses, Firebase Auth and Firestore emulators, and the Next.js dev server on port 3000. Key routes are: / (redirects to /chat), /chat (new chat with optional party_id and q query params), /chat/[chatId] (persisted chat session), /guide, /legal-notice, /privacy-policy, /donate.
